# Coding Rules: Frontend

**Read alongside general.md.** Covers React components, hooks, D3 integration, SVG rendering, styling, performance.

---

## React & Hooks

**Functional components always.** No class components.

**Never import React on every file.** Only import it in files that use JSX.

```typescript
// ✅ Good — file has JSX
import React from 'react';
export function ColorPicker() { return <div>...</div>; }

// ✅ Good — pure utility, no JSX
function isValidHex(hex: string): boolean { ... }

// ✅ Good — TypeScript + JSX, no React import needed (Vite auto-transpiles)
export function MapCanvas() { return <svg>...</svg>; }
```

**Custom hooks own their side effects.** Logic lives in the hook, not the component.

```typescript
// ✅ Good — hook owns the fetch + state
function useGeoData() {
  const [features, setFeatures] = useState<GeoFeature[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/data/europe-modern.geojson')
      .then(r => r.json())
      .then(setFeatures);
  }, []);
  return features;
}

function MapCanvas() {
  const features = useGeoData();
  // component only renders
}

// ❌ Bad — logic split across hook and component
function useGeoData() {
  const [features, setFeatures] = useState<GeoFeature[]>([]);
  return { features, setFeatures };
}

function MapCanvas() {
  const { features, setFeatures } = useGeoData();
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/data/europe-modern.geojson')
      .then(r => r.json())
      .then(setFeatures);
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```

**useCallback for event handlers.** Prevents unnecessary re-renders of children.

```typescript
// ✅ Good
const handleCountryClick = useCallback((countryId: string) => {
  dispatch({ type: 'SET_COLOR', payload: { countryId, color: '#FF0000' } });
}, [dispatch]);

return <MapCanvas onCountryClick={handleCountryClick} />;

// ❌ Bad — new function on every render
return (
  <MapCanvas
    onCountryClick={(id) => dispatch({ type: 'SET_COLOR', payload: { id } })}
  />
);
```

**useReducer for complex state.** MapState is perfect for it — color history, undo/redo, selection.

**useRef for uncontrolled values.** SVG DOM refs (MapCanvas, export target).

**useEffect cleanup.** If loading async data, abort on unmount.

```typescript
// ✅ Good
useEffect(() => {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  fetch('/data/...', { signal: controller.signal })
    .then(r => r.json())
    .catch(e => !controller.signal.aborted && setError(e));
  return () => controller.abort();
}, []);
```

---

## D3 Integration

**D3 lives in useEffect / useLayoutEffect, not render.** D3 mutates DOM; React renders JSX. They don't mix in the function body.

**Pattern:** useRef for SVG container, useEffect for D3 setup/updates.

```typescript
// ✅ Good
function MapCanvas({ features, colors }: Props) {
  const svgRef = useRef<SVGSVGElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!features.length || !svgRef.current) return;

    const svg = d3.select(svgRef.current);
    const projection = d3.geoMercator().fitExtent(/* ... */);
    const pathGenerator = d3.geoPath().projection(projection);

    svg.selectAll('path')
      .data(features, d => d.id)
      .join('path')
      .attr('d', d => pathGenerator(d.geometry));
  }, [features, colors]);

  return <svg ref={svgRef} />;
}

// ❌ Bad — D3 in render
function MapCanvas() {
  const svg = d3.select('svg'); // Wrong! This mutates on every render
  // ...
}
```

**Stable keys in D3 data joins.** Use `.data(features, d => d.id)` so D3 doesn't recreate every path on rerender.

**Only update what changed.** Separate enter/update/exit:

```typescript
svg.selectAll('path')
  .data(features, d => d.id)
  .join(
    enter => enter.append('path'),
    update => update,  // Often identity, update in a separate .attr() chain
    exit => exit.remove()
  )
  .attr('fill', d => colors[d.id] || '#FFF');
```

**No D3 event handlers mixed with React event handlers on same element.** Pick one:

```typescript
// ✅ Good — D3 handlers
svg.selectAll('path')
  .on('click', (event, d) => handleClick(d.id));

// ✅ Good — React handlers
return <g onClick={() => handleClick(id)} />;

// ❌ Bad — mixing them
svg.selectAll('path')
  .on('click', handleD3Click)
  .on('mouseover', handleMouseOver);
// ...then also:
<g onClick={handleReactClick} />  // Unpredictable precedence
```

**D3 projections for flexibility.** `geoMercator` for Phase 1 (standard map). Phase 2 will add `geoAzimuthalEquidistant` for centered maps.

**Performance: memoize projections.** `d3.geoMercator().fitExtent()` is expensive. Do it once per data shape, not per render.

---

## SVG & Rendering

**SVG over Canvas for interactivity.** Each country is a clickable path element — native browser hit detection, hover states, selection visual feedback.

**Declarative class names over inline styles.** Use CSS for hover/active states.

```typescript
// ✅ Good
svg.selectAll('path')
  .attr('class', d => `country-path ${d.id === selectedCountry ? 'selected' : ''}`)
  .attr('fill', d => colors[d.id] || '#FFF');

// With in MapCanvas.css:
// .country-path { cursor: pointer; transition: stroke 150ms; }
// .country-path.selected { stroke: black; stroke-width: 2px; }

// ❌ Bad — inline styles fight CSS
.style('cursor', 'pointer')
.style('stroke', d => d.id === selectedCountry ? 'black' : 'gray')
// Hard to override, no hover states
```

**Namespace SVG elements correctly.** Use D3's `.append('svg:path')` if appending to non-SVG parent (rare in Phase 1).

**Viewbox over fixed width/height** for responsive SVGs (Phase 3; Phase 1 can be fixed 1080×1080).

---

## Styling & Tailwind

**Phase 1 uses plain CSS, not Tailwind.** (Tailwind can be added in Phase 2 if desired.)

**Organize styles by component.** `MapCanvas.css` for MapCanvas, `Controls.css` for Controls.

**CSS variables for theming.** `--primary`, `--success`, `--danger`, etc. (defined in `theme.css`).

```css
/* theme.css */
:root {
  --primary: #667eea;
  --success: #48bb78;
  --danger: #f56565;
}

/* App.css */
.btn-primary { background: var(--primary); }
.btn-success { background: var(--success); }
```

**Use CSS custom properties for dynamic theming.** Phase 3 can add dark mode by flipping `:root` variables.

**BEM naming optional** (Block–Element–Modifier). For Phase 1, keep it simple.

**No CSS-in-JS.** Stick to `.css` files.

---

## Component Structure

**One component per file.** `MapCanvas.tsx` exports `MapCanvas`, not `MapCanvas` + `MapCanvasInner` + helper.

**Props interfaces at top.** Explicit, typed, documented.

```typescript
interface MapCanvasProps {
  features: GeoFeature[];
  colors: Record<string, string>;
  selectedCountry: string | null;
  onCountryClick: (countryId: string) => void;
  onCountryHover: (countryName: string | null) => void;
}

export function MapCanvas({ features, colors, ... }: MapCanvasProps) {
  // ...
}
```

**Small components.** If a component is >300 lines, break it into smaller pieces.

**No prop drilling.** Pass context down (App → MapCanvas), not through 5 intermediate components.

---

## Performance

**React.memo for pure components.** ColorPicker, CountryList are pure (no internal state).

```typescript
export const ColorPicker = React.memo(function ColorPicker({ currentColor, onColorChange }: Props) {
  return (/* ... */);
});
```

**Stable keys in lists.** `<CountryList countries={countries} />` → `.map((country, idx) => <button key={country.id} ...>)`.

**Defer large renders.** If MapCanvas is slow, render it in a Suspense boundary (Phase 2+).

**No array/object creation in render.** Use useMemo if you need to derive data.

```typescript
// ❌ Bad — new array on every render
const sortedCountries = [...countries].sort();

// ✅ Good — memoized
const sortedCountries = useMemo(() => [...countries].sort(), [countries]);
```

---

## Accessibility

**Buttons must be `<button>`, not `<div onClick>`.** Keyboard focus, screen readers.

**SVG paths need labels.** Use `<title>` or `aria-label`.

```typescript
// ✅ Good
svg.selectAll('path')
  .append('title')
  .text(d => d.properties.name);

// ✅ Also good
svg.selectAll('path')
  .attr('aria-label', d => `${d.properties.name}, color ${colors[d.id] || 'white'}`);
```

**Color-blind users:** Don't rely on color alone for information. Add a label or pattern.

**Keyboard navigation.** Arrow keys to move between countries, Enter to toggle selection.

---

## Testing

**Manual testing checklist for Phase 1:**
- [ ] Click a country; it highlights and color picker appears
- [ ] Select color from palette or enter custom hex
- [ ] Undo/redo works (click country, change color 5 times, undo 3 times)
- [ ] Reset clears all colors
- [ ] Save a map, reload the page, load it back
- [ ] Export PNG is exactly 1080×1080
- [ ] No console errors

**Storybook stories (optional, Phase 2+):** ColorPicker, CountryList with sample data.

**Browser fixtures shared by two specs live in `tests/e2e/support/`, never copied.** A
hand-maintained second copy of a snapshot asset or saved record drifts, and then two specs
assert against two different scenes while both stay green. Support modules are not matched by
Playwright's `testMatch`, so they carry helpers safely. A support fixture is still a fixture: it
is served by a route and never promotes geometry into `public/data`.

---

## Visual Tokens and Preference Fallbacks (Phase 2)

**`--map-*` are export tokens: declared once in `:root`, never inside a media or supports
block.** The PNG must be theme- and device-pixel-ratio independent. Redefining
`--map-border-default` under `prefers-color-scheme: dark` would not fail any test that renders
the map — it would just ship a differently-bordered PNG to dark-mode users.
`phase2CssContract.test.ts` walks nested at-rules (a flat regex cannot see the nesting an
accidental override hides in) and asserts each export token is declared exactly once.

**A focus or selection stroke on map geometry uses a `--map-*` token, not `--accent`.** The
chrome accent flips with the OS theme; the square does not.

**Glass is progressive enhancement over an opaque `:root` value.** The translucent value lives
only under `@supports (backdrop-filter: blur(1px))`, and `prefers-reduced-transparency`,
`prefers-contrast: more`, and `forced-colors: active` each restore the opaque baseline and zero
the blur. Readability never depends on what is behind a surface. Glass is permitted on exactly
three surfaces — app bar, inspector shell, map-navigation cluster — and never on the map square,
legend, modal body, toast, or an overlay.

**`filter` is banned on anything that can reach the export clone, and avoided on chrome.**
`filter: brightness()` for a hover tint is one copy-paste from a filter on a `.country-path`,
which html2canvas rasterizes differently than the browser paints it. Author an explicit
`--accent-hover` token instead.

**Border and focus weights are tokens (`--border-width`, `--focus-width`), not literals.** They
are the only reason `prefers-contrast: more` can strengthen every boundary to 2px and every focus
ring to 3px in one place. `1px solid var(--border-default)` opts that rule out silently.

**Positional CSS selectors on interactive controls are banned.** Not just on the action strip —
on any `button`, `input`, `select`, `a`, or `summary`. `:nth-child`, `:first-child`, and
`:last-child` bind a role to an ordinal, and order is copy: the onboarding banner styled its
accent CTA with `button:first-child`, so reordering it would have moved the accent onto
`Dismiss Help` with nothing failing. Key on a role class (`--primary`, `--destructive`,
`--accent`). The ban is enforced by `phase2CssContract.test.ts`, not by review.

---

## Responsive Composition (Phase 2)

**`overflow-x: hidden` belongs on `body`, never on `.app` or any other element.** On a
non-viewport element it computes `overflow-y: auto`, which makes that element its own scroll
container and silently kills `position: sticky` inside it — the app bar simply never moves and
nothing fails. On `body` the value propagates to the viewport and leaves stickiness intact.

**Never assert "no horizontal page scroll" with `scrollWidth <= clientWidth`.** `body` clips
horizontally, so that comparison is vacuously true no matter how far a control overflows.
Measure the elements: collect the bounding rect of every landmark, workspace section, square, and
action, and assert each fits the viewport. That version can fail.

**A tab-order test must move the sequential navigation starting point, not just blur.** Blurring
leaves the starting point where focus was, so `Tab` resumes from the middle of the document and
"proves" an order that begins wherever focus happened to land. Click a non-focusable element at
the top of the document (the product title) first.

**Read a computed style only after its transition settles.** Country paths carry a 150ms stroke
transition, so an immediate read after `emulateMedia` samples a colour in flight. Poll to two
equal consecutive reads.

**Emulation that a browser does not support is not evidence.** Playwright can emulate
`prefers-color-scheme`, `prefers-reduced-motion`, `prefers-contrast`, and `forced-colors`, but
not `prefers-reduced-transparency`. Assert the last one statically and leave it to the physical
acceptance matrix; do not simulate it and label the result browser proof.

**The desktop inspector is one shell.** The `aside` owns the only border, radius, and shadow in
the column; its sections are transparent panes separated by hairlines. Compact and mobile keep
per-section cards because the sections are top-level workspace children there, not shell contents.

---

## Nested Confirmation Dialogs (Phase 2)

**A nested confirmation owns dismissal and the focus trap while it is open.** When
`SaveLoad` shows the dirty-load confirmation, the trap root switches from the outer dialog
to the confirmation element and `Escape` cancels the confirmation only. If the outer dialog
keeps the trap, `Escape` closes the whole surface and the destructive action is skipped
rather than declined.

**Confirmations return focus to the control that opened them.** `Keep Editing` refocuses the
row's `Load This Map`; `Keep Map` refocuses that row's `Delete Saved Map`. Keep a ref map
keyed by a stable row key — index keys break as soon as a row is deleted.

**Scrim dismissal must compare `event.target === event.currentTarget`.** A nested overlay
rendered inside the dialog then cannot be mistaken for the outer scrim.

**`aria-modal` does not hide the dialog behind the confirmation — `inert` does.** `aria-modal`
on the *parent* restricts assistive technology to the parent subtree, which still contains Save,
Delete, Close, and the name input. A CSS scrim blocks the mouse and a `Tab` trap blocks the
keyboard, but a browse/virtual-cursor user reads straight past the confirmation and activates
the destructive control a sighted user cannot reach. So, while a nested confirmation is open:

- render it as a **sibling** of the dialog, under the same overlay — an inert ancestor would
  take the confirmation itself out of the tree;
- set `inert` **and** `aria-hidden="true"` on the dialog element (imperatively; React 18 does
  not serialize the `inert` prop);
- bind the key handler to the **overlay**, not the dialog: an inert dialog can hold no focus, so
  a handler bound there never fires;
- restore focus from an **effect**, not from the click handler — the target is still inert when
  the handler runs.

**Escape dismisses the innermost open confirmation, never a layer above it.** Branch over every
open layer in order (`pendingLoad` → `pendingDeleteKey` → close), and add the new branch in the
same change that adds a new confirmation. A handler that knows about only one of two sibling
confirmations discards the other one's prompt and dumps the user back at the opener.

---

## Global Action Strip (Phase 2)

**Action order is copy, so never style an action by its position.** `:nth-child(3)` and
`:last-child` repaint a *different* button the moment the strip is reordered, and nothing fails
— the destructive tint and the filled CTA just move. Give every action a stable
`data-action` and a role class (`controls__action--destructive`, `controls__action--primary`)
and key the CSS on that.

**`Export PNG` is the only filled action.** Exactly one `controls__action--primary` may exist in
the composed DOM; everything else is a neutral outline button.

**Disabled and busy are native, never simulated.** `disabled` + `aria-busy` on the button
itself, driven by the parent's truth. `aria-disabled` on a still-clickable button spoofs the
state (T-02-53). Labels swap exactly: `Export PNG` ⇄ `Exporting PNG…`.

**Content reset and camera reset are different actions and never sit together.**
`Reset All Colors` is undoable color history and lives in the inspector; `Reset View` is camera
only and lives **solely** in `CompositionBar`. The composed DOM must contain exactly one visible
`Reset View` — assert its absence in every other control component's test, not just the presence
in one.

**A presentational control that starts an async owner action needs its own synchronous
activation lock.** The parent's `isExporting` is only true one render later, so two activations
in the same tick both pass the prop check. Guard with a `useRef` flag cleared in `finally`; the
control stays event-only and owns no transaction state.

---

## Creator-Safe Status Copy (Phase 2)

**`ToastRegion` is a boundary, not a renderer.** Everything it receives is untrusted until it
matches the allowlist: an exact approved string, or a bounded dynamic pattern. Anything else
degrades to the severity fallback (`Map updated.` / warning / error). Hashes, projection terms,
schema versions, file paths, stack frames, and DOM exception names therefore cannot reach a
creator even if a future call site passes one straight through.

**A dynamic message must bound its semantic parameter, not just its prefix.**
`^Centered on .{1,100}\.$` is an allowlisted *prefix* — it happily announces a 64-character
content hash. Bound the parameter to the shape the real value has (`Centered on` takes a country
name: initial uppercase letter, ≤60 characters).

**Derive the bound from the real data, never from an assumed charset.** An invented
"safe characters" list silently degraded `Falkland Islands / Malvinas` and
`Allies & "Central Powers"` to the generic fallback. Check the candidate pattern against the
whole shipped catalog before committing it; prefer a length + control-character bound over a
character allowlist, since React escapes the text anyway.

**Copy that names catalog data is generated from the catalog constants**
(`APPROVED_PERIOD_ANNOUNCEMENTS`), so a manifest-supplied label can never reach the live region.
Listing a deferred snapshot's copy in the allowlist does not make it reachable — reachability is
decided by `resolvePeriodOptions`.

**Every message a component can emit needs a positive allowlist test in the same change.** A new
`onStatusMessage(...)` string with no test is a silent downgrade to `Map updated.` — it renders,
so nothing fails.

**Onboarding and status copy never advertise a deferred feature.** No "coming soon", no keyboard
shortcut that is not bound, no control that does not exist.

---

## Transaction Hooks (Phase 2)

A *transaction hook* (`useComposition{Save,Load,Export}Transaction`) is a pure factory plus a
thin React wrapper. The factory holds the rules and is what the unit tests drive; the wrapper
holds React state only. Vitest runs on the `node` environment — a factory that needs a DOM or
a renderer to be tested is the wrong shape.

**A hook that owns a lock must create its transaction exactly once.** `useMemo`/`useState` with
a dependency array rebuilds the object when any dependency identity changes, and a rebuilt
transaction carries a **fresh, unlocked** activation flag — a second export can then start while
the first still holds the camera lease. Keep the options in a ref, update the ref in a
`useLayoutEffect`, and create the transaction lazily inside the returned callback:

```typescript
const optionsRef = useRef(options);
const transactionRef = useRef<Transaction | null>(null);
useLayoutEffect((): void => { optionsRef.current = options; });

const run = useCallback((): Promise<Outcome> => {
  // Created here, not during render: passing ref-reading closures to a factory
  // in the render body trips react-hooks/refs.
  transactionRef.current ??= createTransaction({
    getThing: () => optionsRef.current.getThing(),
    ...
  });
  return transactionRef.current.run();
}, []);
```

This also makes the returned callback **stable**, so a toast `retry` can call it directly
instead of bouncing through a handler ref.

**Resolve the live handle once per activation, then hold it.** Re-reading
`getMapCanvasHandle()` after an `await` can return a canvas that was rebound by the 1200px
transition, and releasing a lease on a handle that never issued it leaves the original frozen.

**Every lock is cleared in one outermost `finally`, in this order:** activation flag → lease
release → busy flag, each side effect after the first wrapped so a throw cannot skip the rest.
A stuck flag is not a cosmetic bug: it disables the feature for the remainder of the session.

**Owner callbacks (`onOutcome`, status, focus) must never be able to strand a lock.** Either
call them after the `finally`, or wrap them so a throw is logged (`console.error`) rather than
propagated. Report the outcome *after* the lease is released so input is live before the user
sees the toast.

**Re-entrancy is refused synchronously, before the first `await`**, and the refusal is silent —
it emits no outcome. Reporting it would show a second toast for a click that changed nothing.

**Owner state stays in the composition root.** A transaction hook takes accessors
(`getCompositionName`, `getLegendBlocker`) and never becomes the source of truth for state that
another transaction also reads.

---

## Composition Root (Phase 2)

`src/App.tsx` is wiring and creator-safe feedback. It owns durable state and hands accessors
down; it never re-implements a transaction, a validation, or a camera.

**One handle accessor, shared by identity.** App holds exactly one `MapCanvasHandle` in a ref,
binds it with a stable callback ref, and passes *the same* `getMapCanvasHandle` function to the
save, load, and export hooks. Three separate accessors would mean three private handles, and
the 1200px remount would leave some of them stale. Assert the identity, not the shape:

```typescript
expect(loadDependencies.getMapCanvasHandle).toBe(saveDependencies.getMapCanvasHandle);
```

**Never import a camera controller into App.** `useCameraController` belongs to `MapCanvas`. A
second controller paints a second camera and the visible SVG stops following the handle every
App callback is derived from. This is worth a structural test — the defect is an import.

**The legend renders through `MapWorkspace`'s typed `legendSlot`, inside the canonical SVG.**
A `<LegendOverlay/>` rendered as a *sibling* of `svg.map-canvas` is silently dropped by the
export clone, and `isSingleCanonicalComposition` still **passes**, because neither the source
nor the SVG then contains a legend. The only guards are containment assertions:

| Level | Assertion | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| Unit (`App.test.tsx`, static markup) | legend index between the camera layer and `</svg>` | the refactor, at commit time |
| Real-app E2E | `svg.map-canvas > [data-layer="legend"]` count 1 | the same, in a real browser |
| Fixture E2E | — | **nothing**: the fixture re-implements the slot wiring |

Never relocate or relax those two. See `export.md`, "A fixture cannot prove legend placement".

**Responsive sections are keyed siblings, not conditional subtrees.** The map and the inspector
carry stable `key`s so crossing 1200px *moves* the nodes instead of remounting the map; state
that any remounted section shows (`useInspectorUiState`, `compositionName`,
`savedColorsBaseline`) lives above the branch. `savedColorsBaseline` and `compositionName` stay
out of the history snapshot — history is colors-only, which is the only reason undo/redo cannot
resurrect a selection the active scene does not contain.

**Unit-test the root with mocked hooks, in static markup.** Vitest runs on `node`: render with
`renderToStaticMarkup`, mock `useGeoData` and the three transaction hooks, and assert what App
*hands down* plus what the composed DOM *contains*. Behavior that needs effects, refs, or input
belongs in the Chrome E2E suite.
